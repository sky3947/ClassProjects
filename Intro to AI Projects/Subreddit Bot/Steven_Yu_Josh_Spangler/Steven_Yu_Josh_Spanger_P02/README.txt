1) The data/ folder contains all (subreddit v. subreddit) classifications, where each
   folder contains training, development, and test data files. Because of this, 
   data_collector.py doesn't need to be run (as it cannot be ran anyways due to missing re   ddit credentials). Make sure all six folders from data/ are in the working directory as   the classifier.py and data_collector.py files

2) out.txt contains all the iteration test data from a sample run of classifiers.py on the   data found in the data folder.

3) To be in the 90-100 "A level work" scale, we have collected more than 200 reddit posts    (1000 in total), and incorporated multiple subreddits in our project. 

4) Good luck on your finals!
