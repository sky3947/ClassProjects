the big c4c update please upvote this thread to make sure all our users see it nbsp hello fellow poets big changes are coming to r ocpoetry here are the new rules 1 link posts are no longer allowed text posts only 2 all posts will now default to feedback request 3 you must provide feedback to 2 other poems for every poem you post you must link to them in your own post or your poem will be removed we will begin enforcing this rule 2 days from the time of this post 5 if you would like to post your poem but not provide another user feedback you must do so in dedicated sharethreads posted by the automoderator sharethreads will be posted weekly by the automoderator you can find them here http www reddit com r ocpoetry wiki sharethreads in these threads you may share any poem or chat about whatever you want without the pressure of critique lastly flair points are being deprecated and picture flairs have been added you can change your picture flair by selecting a new one in the sidebar nbsp why all these new rules we mods wanted to encourage a more collaborative community and reward helpful users look at the original discussion explaining the creation of ocpoetry here http www reddit com r poetry comments 25rl4k huge changes to rpoetry and we need your help and here http www reddit com r poetry comments 1zgl9s mod a week of no oc and here http www reddit com r poetry comments 27ufxg discussion rpoetry is not big enough to split in as you can see many of the problems that existed when oc was allowed on r poetry have carried over to ocpoetry the initial months had good amounts of feedback but we re once again inundated averaging 50 posts per day with very few of them gaining any attention upvotes or comments there s simply too many posts for any of them to get the attention they need nothing stays on the frontpage for long enough what we re trying to do is make sure that users that put in effort to make quality posts and give helpful feedback are rewarded nbsp but i enjoyed all the just sharing posts why are you removing them we re not removing them exactly users are still allowed to post poems as a comment inside the sharethreads it is important that our users have a place where they can post freely without judgement or critique nbsp i m new to poetry and don t know how to give feedback good news everyone feels this way no one is truly qualified to judge someone else s art but what you can do is tell the poet how you felt about their poem which lines you liked disliked as long as you put in effort and are honest and specific it doesn t matter if you re not an expert give the type of feedback you d like to receive if you want to improve your feedback here s a small list http www reddit com r ocpoetry wiki feedbackcritiques of questions you can ask yourself when reading a poem to give you angles of attack additionally here http www reddit com r ocpoetry wiki flairrewards is an enormous list of great feedback given by ocpoetry users reading others feedback is a great way to improve your own nbsp what are the bare minimum requirements for feedback i just want to post my poem we re not going to put specific requirements on feedback just as long as you put visible effort into your post please no one liners this is a great poem i didn t like this wow thats powerful none of these are constructive substantiate your feedback with explanation and suggestions even asking the poet questions can be helpful feedback doesn t necessarily have to be contained in one comment it can be a conversation you had with the poet if you re struggling check out the 2 pieces of feedback that the author posted alongside his poem and use that as a measuring stick of what is expected and if you have absolutely no clue or inclination for giving feedback you can always post in sharethreads nbsp my poem isn t getting any feedback the intention of the 2 critiques per poem posted rule is to make sure that the number of comments is always greater than the number of poems when trying to find a poem to comment on please look at this page http oc reddit com r ocpoetry search q flair 3a 27requests 27 restrict sr on sort new t all ocf and prioritize posts with no comments hopefully this way no one s poem is left behind and whenever you leave feedback ask the user to reciprocate and give you feedback nbsp why did you remove the flair points we initially added the flair points system so that users would be encouraged to give others feedback however keeping them updated relies heavily on the users nominating comments for flair points which rarely happened with the new c4c system the flair points are unnecessary and it allows us to replace them with picture flairs which i think are cooler we can also award special flairs to outstanding users nbsp i can t find poetname in the picture flair feel free to make a request and i ll add it as soon as i can there s enough room for a hundred or so more picture flairs nbsp this idea is terrible and i m unsubscribing from ocpoetry maybe you re right if so we re 100 willing to revert these changes however we cannot know how this might go until we ve at least attempted it the changes could be great let s find out together nbsp nbsp remember the subreddit needs the users to be helpful cooperative and friendly to function with your help we can turn this subreddit into an even greater hub for poets new and experienced alike we need you to make liberal use of the report function to help us moderate and make sure everyone is putting in equal effort towards a better r

trigger warning for some pretty explicit content i wrote this when i was still really grappling with some things about 2 years ago and i m finally almost feeling ready to share it with other humans meant to be read aloud we ran across rooftops one night and kissed on the edge we stood above the world watching the people below as their lives passed before us how easily they could see us skin exposed lips touching but no one ever looks up and somewhere between touching the sky and falling into your bed you said you re fun and i don t know what that means in fact i have it on good authority that i m not nbsp at age six a j calls me goody two shoes because i m afraid of getting caught out of class at eight i learn what it means to be a stand in friend when my sister isn t around to play and at thirteen brittany s trying to hand me pills that she found on the street and telling me that i m not fun like my sister she would have taken them she s not afraid nbsp i m thirteen and i learn to stay inside because around here men drive around with their pants down and girls disappear in the middle of the day found later weighing five pounds less from loss of dignity nbsp i m thirteen and i m always home because i think that i can somehow tether my sister and my mother to our apartment to me if i can cook and clean and keep everyone safe nbsp i m thirteen and older guys come and go from our home like it s theirs like my sister is theirs and it s like their belts are always undone their faces always hungry and when i try to make them leave they burn me with their cigarettes bang on the doors and rattle the windows and they re laughing and yelling and i m standing in the middle of the room with my hands pressed against my ears counting the different ways to die nbsp i m thirteen and my sister is missing my mother sits at home watching television and i m searching the neighborhood with a girl and her grandmother nbsp she s fourteen and we find her outside the house of the boy whose brand is still fresh on my thigh and she s surrounded by men big men tall men older men drinking and laughing men nbsp my sister falls on me and i realize that i can t hear anything their faces all blurred into one giant portrait of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught and someone needs to remind me to walk nbsp she s fourteen and describing the things that he made her do to his dick she s fourteen and her eyes are rolling back into her head she s fourteen and the emts have to put her on a stretcher because she can t stand nbsp and somewhere in the background my mother is stopping her boyfriend from going over there to kill someone and maybe she s right and maybe i m the one who s crazy but what kind of mother says nbsp no don t hurt the man who raped my baby nbsp my kind of mother protects rapists my kind of mother always puts the man first and my kind of mother has plenty of experience because for years she shielded my father from view hovering above us like a dark cloud while he raped me again and again nbsp my kind of mother sends children out alone into a world where it s too dangerous to borrow sugar from your neighbor and when we come back bruised and broken she tells us to sit down and shut up or she ll give us something to cry about nbsp for my kind of mother this is just another thing she has to deal with nbsp and when at sixteen i told her that eric had molested me my kind of mother invited him to stay in our home and told him he was like a son to her nbsp so i learned to say yes when i m scared and violence is the only other answer to say yes when they need me when they want me when i have to to say yes least of all when i want to nbsp when you say i m fun i don t know what you mean but i hope it means you like me that i pleased you i hope it means i m safe but if you don t call me tomorrow or next week if you don t call me again that s okay because somewhere inside me i m still just afraid of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught nbsp https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8pa4tg remix 16 e0aqea3 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8pa4tg remix 16 e0aqea3 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8oyp1c black mirror feedback request e0al90p https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8oyp1c black mirror feedback request e0al90p

start with a feeling it s not so much a feeling that you have on your own it s a manufactured thing something you claw out of the earth with soft unfocused hands as if god will spit gold onto your fingers at random call it finding inspiration when you bare your teeth at the sky and demand beauty from it finally find it when the clouds cry on your window with their pitter pat pat tapping on the glass whimpering is this what you wanted but it s not not quite not exactly not that imagined ecstasy in the mind look at the rain shrug it ll do x200b now take words and lay them out on an operating table they are stripped and silent worthless until you make something of them pick the ones you like and toss the rest tear them apart letter by letter by sound by the taste of them on your tongue this one too bitter that one too sweet and paste them down on posterboard like a ransom note to the world lay with them let their blood dry to a paste the copper of it starts to sting rip it up try again x200b now bring it outside this frankenstein s monster of beauty and torture thrust it on stage and make it dance watch its feet move in that strange ballet that isn t quite lovely but not quite bleak make it sing and it comes out strangled and this thing that was beaten out of the world out of your soul is just as sad and broken as you are and when you cast it out and beg to god make it beautiful make me beautiful when you take that broken glass and turn it not on the world but on yourself that is poetry x200b rip it up try again x200b 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments axh4jg root canal ehunzb8 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments axhaui a big love ehuncs7

when i tell you i m lonely i m telling you that i can t stand being alone yet i hate the noise and constant stimulation that comes with groups when i tell you i m lonely what i m actually saying is that i have more friends than i care to have because i m a bad friend and can t handle the pressure so i stay home and pretend i m busy when i tell you i m lonely i m telling you that i have options but i refuse to use them because i d rather spend all my time with you i can t stand to constant sadness that comes with having met you because every time i breathe i can feel the smoke of old cigarettes fill my lungs because you already took my breath away if only i could tell you how i really felt and how every time you stood me up i only blamed myself because i m stuck chasing a dream that should ve woken up from months ago i know that we would never work and yet i still want to try i can t escape the constant scraping in the back of my skull telling me that it s my fault and that i should ve never said hi in the first place because i got too attached and now you re the only one i think about i guess what i m trying to say is hey i m lonely and you re the only thing that could fill the hole in my chest that i made for you 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments du6xis between 0 and 1 f773btd utm source share utm medium web2x 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments dtzk64 breathe f772gvc utm source share utm medium web2x

springtime when i was eight i was amazed how you knew the name for every bird the magpies i knew because we would feed them every afternoon but an unknown noise in the night that you said was a boobook i would wake up in the mornings on an old pull out cot in the shed and bask in a distant musical melody they were lyrebirds you told me we would take walks in the afternoon and you would know a name for every distant song nbsp summer when i was twenty eight i stopped by for lunch on the long drive down to melbourne you recalled names quicker than me the defence minister the waitress the man who brought the firewood you told me and my fianceé about the end of the second world war you were working in a local bar and had felt the world change in a single day we ate crêpes in the sun and you told us things we didn t know nbsp autumn we were scared and you must have been too but you put on a brave face as always there s no use complaining you said that s just life we were outside shaking out a tablecloth and four magpies were waiting for the crumbs you watched them watching us but i do wonder who ll feed the birds nbsp on the counter is the glossy brochure of an incomprehensible drug with an unpronounceable name a miracle treatment they called it but three months later that colorful pamphlet was still there and you were not nbsp winter i flew down for the funeral the flight both too short and too long all at once i slept in your shed again that night and in stubborn defiance of decency the birds sang in the morning nbsp springtime my office is on a narrow peninsula across the harbour from the city and its crowds some days between the code reviews the strategy docs and the one on ones i walk downstairs and have lunch by the water i throw my leftovers to the birds seagulls koels a hopelessly lost fairy wren nbsp some day i ll have children maybe grandchildren of my own i will teach them what you taught me an uncompromising kindness the joy of a book and a sunny place to sit to be patient with others even when you were always so quick nbsp and i will teach them to always feed the birds 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments bumpoq pinup fiction eph3877 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments buftsx outofbody eph3xag

okay i m nervous about posting but i love sharing my work and it doesn t get a whole lot of feedback on tumblr don t sleep with a poet she ll turn your thighs into couplets the way they wrap around her like twin vines spiraling up a brick wall if you invite a poet into your bed she ll carve stars into your palms so that every caress of yours paints constellations across her skin complex enough to make an astronomer leap across her body when she kisses your neck it s no longer muscle and bone and skin she s turned it into a sonnet of rushing rivers a b a b c d c d e f e f where every stressed syllable is a kiss upon your jaw and the unstressed ones are fingertips sinking into your chest g g the poet will drag haikus out of your eyes how they are green like patches of overwatered grass and tell stories of centuries come to pass 17 syllables on how you are so young and yet seem ancient like the great kings of old don t sleep with a poet she will write pages of odes about your mouth on her thighs and how your lips trail like a comet down her calves she ll turn you inside out and take away everything that makes you alive you ll forget you were ever anything but words scrawled onto scrap pieces of paper feedback 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 5rse5s comment ddb7uef feedback 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 5roih0 comment ddb836b
