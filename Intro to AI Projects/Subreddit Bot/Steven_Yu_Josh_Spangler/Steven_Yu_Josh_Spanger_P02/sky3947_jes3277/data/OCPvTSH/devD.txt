i wrote this thing up as a response to the question how do you get started writing poetry on the r poetry board a few days ago and people really liked it so i m sharing it here as well a lot of novices approach poetry trying to write out their feelings explore gigantic ideas sum up existence or love or life with a single verse my advice is to narrow the scope just look at one thing i mean actually really look at it a tree in your yard the vapors coming off a pot of boiling water the color of the wood of the table what that person said to you offhand the other day you know how when people are learning to draw they just make sketches of everything they draw hands like a trillion times in different positions you re just sketching but with words right now just try and notice a very small thing as truely as you can five principles to follow use as few words as possible too many words can fill your poem with static embrace imperfection you will feel like you ve done a bad job and not really described something as completely as you could this is a good thing poetry works its magic through being imperfect a poem moves and moves fast it s like the heisenberg uncertainty principle you can know the velocity or the position of a poem but not both allow yourself to only capture one listen you ll start to feel ideas or sensations or words pull you in different directions at first it takes experience and judgment to know which ones to follow and you can t follow them all in a single poem just listen to that interior sense and go wherever the writing takes you it might make absolutely zero sense but you re writing poetry it can not make sense allow yourself to mash up words ideas images or feelings indiscriminately and just see what works later you re a mad scientist or a mad chef i suppose and you might discover unexpected things through your experiments don t worry about editing until you re done revise set whatever you ve written aside for a day or a week or a year and come back to it read it as if it were written by someone else ask what was this person trying to say how are they trying to say it is there a way it could have been said better most people who start writing poetry do not ever learn to revise and holy shit your poems are always going to suck unless you learn to revise and then of course once you feel like you re getting the hang of it you can go back and learn about all the technical terminology and shit like that read a lot of really off the wall and classic poets at all times and try to notice what they do and i thought it could be a fun writing prompt for the sub just make a little poem sketch of something today let it rest for a few hours give it a quick read over and post it as a comment here i ll be doing this too submit as many times as you d like feedback rules are suspended in this thread of course

i watched my father kill a bird today a baby fledgling with its adult feathers poking through i caught it before we saw how it was curled in on itself bent broken backwards no choice in it best to kill it quick i wondered what it would be like to watch something die whether i should prove that i m a man step up to the plate knock it out the park shoot my shot i nearly offered swallowed my tongue felt a rush my father voice was gruff take it out back he said i don t want anyone to see this his hands shook as he loaded the gun it didn t die immediately again again again it shook and quivered and its broken wings beat against the ground i watched the first shot i couldn t watch the last it was dead after the first he said it was dead after the first i nodded and he came back inside miserable it taught me something about me and him how it means to be a man i m not sure what yet but all i can see is that broken baby bird and my fathers shaking hands 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments ao00q6 comment efyfeet 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments anxjqp comment efyf136
