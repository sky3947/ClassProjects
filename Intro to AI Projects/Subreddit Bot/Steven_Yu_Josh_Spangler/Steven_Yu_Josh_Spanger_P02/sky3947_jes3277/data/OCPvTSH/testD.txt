hi i m ernie for a dumb reason rice malfunction my handle is u dogtim i have been an editor and writing coach professionally for the past ten years and a writer for ohhhhh just about forever i ve put this series together to help beginners give feedback as you re likely aware we require everyone give two thoughtful responses to other poets on this sub with every poem they share the point of this exercise is twofold it is to help you improve your powers of observation and to help others understand how their poems affect their readers but if you ve never really been a part of a community like this before it can be daunting to offer your responses to other people s deep dark feelies this essay series addresses some of the most commonly asked questions about feedback that the mods get previous entries in this series what to expect when you re expecting https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8rlgb8 feedback forum what to expect when youre expecting the deeper meaning https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8tp9ta feedback forum the deeper meaning i wouldn t know how to fix a poem how many times have you gotten feedback like this the following is a fictional comment and any resemblance to actual feedback living or dead is purely coincidental this is great it really flows and the images are just so beautiful but if i had one critique it would be to change spongy to extramarital because it would make the rhyme stronger i see variations on this template feedback in the comments in ocpoetry every day i ve also heard it in person in countless writing workshops classes etc it runs from one long run on sentence to a max of about four and sounds basically like this sentence one emphatic like dislike wow this was great hmm i didn t like it sentence two the imagery flow was beautiful it s always a bit about the imagery or flow i have no idea why sounds poetical i expect sentence three aka the one thing wrong aka the fix if i had one criticism just change etc sentence four the optional motivational tag keep writing i d love to see more from you many new peer editors approach this assigned task of giving feedback with a bit of dread after all you re about to tell strangers on the internet that their super personal secret love poems might be bad and i think this is a totally reasonable way to feel nobody here has met face to face and it s really hard to judge how they ll respond nobody wants to be outright mean to strangers about their deep dark feelies i mean let s assume we re all here in a poetry community in good faith and that there are no trolls but if you re not sure how to give proper feedback it s also natural to feel a bit lost how am i a nonexpert supposed to give criticism otherwise your mandatory feedback will look just complementary and the evil mods the queens and kings of censorship will delete your poem later on so you have to provide criticism if that s a new thing to you you ll try to fix a moment you didn t like that s where comments like the above come from the desire to be nice to strangers plus the desire to fulfill the requirements of feedback as a peer editor unfortunately comments like the above are mostly useless don t take my word for it here s fantasy author neil gaiman on revision show your story to friends whose opinion you respect and who like the kind of thing that it is remember when people tell you something s wrong or doesn t work for them they are almost always right when they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it they are almost always wrong i m a professional editor people pay me to help them with their texts most people believe my job is to fix people s books poems papers articles etc because i am a writing expert i myself believed this when i was training to be an editor this is way off i remember doing this a lot i d read through someone s academic essay and then struggle to articulate how it was wrong and how i would fix it and then everyone came away feeling awkward and unhelped but that s the opposite approach to good editing good editing empowers authors to make their own decisions i believe that every piece of writing can be powerful and effective and while i certainly have control over my own writing i can t make decisions for others in order to help my editing clients i have to make them believe that too and the way i do that is by making them feel competent capable and intelligent my first job is to listen and empathize the author is my primary resource to helping them create a good piece of writing if they feel intimidated uncomfortable attacked annoyed sad or closed off i will be totally unable to do my job properly because i won t get an unfiltered sense of what they intend with this piece of writing and therefore whatever i suggest will be totally irrelevant regardless of how expert it is nobody s going to take my advice if they don t feel like i understand them properly talking about how to fix things is really difficult and ultimately as a reader it s not your job i m going to repeat this every fix you give will be ignored they do not help that s because your suggestions inevitably turn out to be ways that you yourself would write the piece in front of you and you are not the author you re never going to be an expert in anyone else s intentions when you tell someone how to fix their writing the implicit message is you are doing this wrong and i am doing this right the person you re giving feedback to even if they re nice about it will probably wind up ignoring whatever you have to say every author is dealing with their own baggage so instead of telling them how dumb it was to pack so much maybe instead pick up the baggage and carry its weight for a bit here s my advice when you feel that urge to fix something what you should do is note when and where you feel that desire to change the text finish reading the poem and then come back to that troubling spot and then instead of telling them change this ask why did you use this your best bet to giving good feedback is to understand the person in front of you that means ask questions ask a lot of questions get the person to open up about the writing experience what their inspirations were what they wanted to say when you notice something you want to fix what you re noticing is something you d do differently and that s an opportunity to learn about how someone else perceives the world this is obviously way harder on the internet but try to think of feedback as a realm of conversation rather than one way advice and go into your feedback expecting a reply good feedback in an online forum situation may take a few days and a few replies to tease out the great irony with editing is that you cannot fix someone else s work you can however understand them and their intentions a bit better which will encourage them to understand your perspective on the poem which will encourage them to fix things all by themselves

the gypsy man plays on warm summer days and on nights neath a lonesome bright star he plucks a soft tune as he howls at the moon with the song of his spanish guitar there s a bump on a part of this gypsy man s cart and it thumps with each turn of the wheel it keeps him in time with his plucking and rhyme as he rides it from rome to castile the people all flock as the gypsy cart rocks and approaches the town from afar and they dance to his song as he rolls right along to the beat of his spanish guitar the rich folks will waltz to cheap german schmaltz and operas are all of the rage but the song from the cart has ten times more heart than the music of balls or the stage so i rosin my bow and i join in the show and i sing to the moon and the stars but no fiddle can play in the rapturous way of that gypsy s sweet spanish guitar 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 3kpvqa sirens tune cv1dfks 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 3kxjn2 why waste time being bitter cv1csb3

46 891 and rising not bad for a niche sub that s 5 and a half ish years old we ve been through a lot together starting out as a split from r poetry deciding what to do about feedback making new rules towards same working on the ever present backlog of open requests creating annual ish books celebrating the best of the sub and more sometimes we ve had growing pains mods come and go and we ve all got lives outside this sub sometimes we ve just had pains users can t or won t separate personal from quasi professional and end up getting banned as a result of their resorting to personal attacks we ve had users here that go out play submission roulette and get published we ve had those that self publish instead mostly we ve had thousands of drive by posters those that post 1 5 poems and are never seen again except as a possible number in the subscriber count up to this point mods have taken care of the abandoned poems when it comes to feedback those that go over a week with nary a comment or just the hurr durr i likes it can i pet the bunny george type reply and we re still doing that problem with that approach though is that the bigger we grow the more unsustainable that approach becomes we re getting to the point now where we ll regularly have 50 100 posts needing a look at for feedback past the 1 week point and a few hundred in the open queue to look at for reflairing the ideal case is self sufficiency and nominal automation to the extent possible which is to say users consistently providing quality feedback automod doing its job and the mod team mostly on cleanup duty as needed e g reflairing minimal amounts of having to provide feedback to abandoned posts banning the occasional idiot etc so question for the community how do we make this place more self sustaining secondary to that how do we improve and ideally maintain post feedback quality

hi i m ernie for a dumb reason pudding my handle is u dogtim i have been an editor and writing coach professionally for the past ten years and a writer for ohhhhh just about forever i ve put this series together to help beginners give feedback as you re likely aware we require everyone give two thoughtful responses to other poets on this sub with every poem they share the point of this exercise is twofold it is to help you improve your powers of observation and to help others understand how their poems affect their readers but if you ve never really been a part of a community like this before it can be daunting to offer your responses to other people s deep dark feelies this essay series addresses some of the most commonly asked questions about feedback that the mods get previous entries in this series what to expect when you re expecting https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8rlgb8 feedback forum what to expect when youre expecting the deeper meaning https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8tp9ta feedback forum the deeper meaning how to fix a poem https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8wnrdz feedback forum how to fix a poem active reading expands the universe https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 904z8u feedback forum active reading expands the universe what are we even doing here in this poetry forum anonymous strangers will read your poetry in earnest and tell you what s working and what s not this is a wild gift it is not often in life people will tell you what they really think today s guide rather than on writing feedback is how to get the most out of reading and replying to feedback on your own work the following represent a few principles i think will guide you well before you post take a deep breath maybe drink a glass of water if you re like me or like most anybody who makes art you have an intense anxiety about making shitty art what if they hate it what if worse they don t and then expect great things from me forever what if my poem is garbage and ergo i am also garbage and i should give up forever i tend to oscillate between despair and delusions of granduer i am many years into my writing career these feelings do not go away sorry you re a brave soul usually the more frightened you are about sharing a piece the more important the piece is to you remember the poem isn t you you made it you care about it but whatever it is that people say don t take it personally give it some space to roam free in the world for awhile down to business if you want to get the most out of this whole feedback you need to come in with some questions so what are you trying to do with your poem what do you think is working and what are you most concerned about maybe write some answers to those questions down somewhere else then when you publish explain nothing let the work speak for itself usually it s best to leave out an explanation of what you were feeling that day or what you think the work is about i see people post explanations and concerns and author s notes with their poetry all the time here and i completely understand the urge to shield yourself from criticism believe me but when you do that you ll be directing people s attention artificially in ways that the poem itself is not doing withholding your explanations and concerns until the post reading discussion gives space for your readers to appreciate or not appreciate the writing on their own terms if they totally miss the point that s great seeing that people miss the point is still feedback of a sort it means they re either 1 not the intended audience for this piece and can probably be ignored but still thanked or 2 your metaphor image wordplay is not coming across the way you d hoped it s also significant if nobody says anything no feedback or upvotes means something too also it s not like when you publish a book you get a disclaimer at the beginning which reads please don t be to harsh on me when i was writing this book my cat was going through surgery for its ehs engorged hairball syndrome and my lover kept mailing me dead cabbages and all of my grandmas died etc this isn t how i conduct face to face editing sessions by the way this is just advice for publishing when i m working with someone i try and find out what their aims and concerns before i read anything but publishing well publish with your head held high as if you intended even the typos take the note and say thank you the first time i ever did a show i was in this theatre camp i was probably 10 11 years old something like that we d just all done a big run through bunch of little kids scripts in hand running around onstage and forgetting our lines we all sat in the lobby of the theatre and our director started going through all the notes he had on the production when he got to the whiniest kid who even though he was very whiny was great on stage generally and had a large role and asked him to make eye contact with his scene partners and move slightly stage right the kid started complaining it wasn t his fault he was trying to but the light was in the wrong place etc etc an expression of total exhaustion crossed the director s face he held up his hand to shut the kid up and said when the director gives you a note you take it and say thank you the kid tried to give another excuse and the director stuck out his tongue and blew a raspberry the kid was totally alarmed and sputtering we all laughed and the director explained i m trying to make you look good onstage you don t know what you look like onstage i m the only one out there in the audience you re all backstage trying to remember lines blocking mooning each other giggling to each other about who saw who making out with what i don t know whose fault it was i don t know why it s a problem and it s not important if i talk to you it looked like you were the problem which means you should fix it or you will continue to look bad on stage which i assume you don t want to do at this point he mimed giving a small creature a headlock so you strangle the annoying little muppet that s giving excuses in your brain take the note and say thank you now you try we all then practiced taking a note mimed putting elmo in a headlock and saying thank you it was a pretty great theatre camp this odd and digressive anecdote illustrates that trying to defend yourself is hugely annoying and hugely counterproductive when someone gives you feedback on your writing they re giving it from the useful perspective of outside your own head as i ve said before your readers are always right when it comes to how they feel about your poetry how could they not be right it s how they feel no your readers aren t burdened with whatever anxieties or confidences you ve got about your own writing they are wise in ways you cannot be you need them and even if you think they re way off base they still took some time out of their day to try and make you look good onstage take the note and say thank you following up remember those worries you had what you thought was working and what you were concerned about dig your responses to those questions out once you ve managed to snag a comment or two this is your chance to ask your captive audience a few follow up questions on that subject specifically you want to ask open ended questions and you want to ask them in such a way that doesn t lead them to an opinion for instance wrong did you like the line about the mattresses this questions is kind of useless for three reasons 1 it s clear that you the writer liked the line about mattresses 2 it s a yes or no question which shuts down dialogue 3 what s like much better how did the line about mattresses make you feel this question gives your reader a bit of breathing room to decide for themselves what their reaction was it s also neutral on whether you think the line is working or not you should also push your readers on anything they said that s non specific this is often where i get my best feedback and it s frequently from people whose first comment is something like i dunno it s good bad the flow was cool sucked ask them what do you mean by the flow and where why did you think it worked flopped questions like these make both of you think with greater clarity and depth about the writing on the page now you should have some great ideas on how to revise how to revise try to write fail twice give up get depressed scream make coffee write unrelated things for a few days descend into frustration wake up and jot down a brilliant solution to the problem only to read your half awake scribblings later in the day to realize it s shit take a nap read the feedback again and feel sad about how bad you are at everything write something you think is shit at the time but realize much later that it s spot on replace the weak words with stronger ideas i wish there were some other way of doing this besides trial and error and a lot of failure george saunders has a wonderful mixed metaphor https www theguardian com books 2017 mar 04 what writers really do when they write for the revision process how then to proceed my method is i imagine a meter mounted in my forehead with p on this side positive and n on this side negative i try to read what i ve written uninflectedly the way a first time reader might without hope and without despair where s the needle accept the result without whining then edit so as to move the needle into the p zone enact a repetitive obsessive iterative application of preference watch the needle adjust the prose watch the needle adjust the prose rinse lather repeat through sometimes hundreds of drafts like a cruise ship slowly turning the story will start to alter course via those thousands of incremental adjustments the artist in this model is like the optometrist always asking is it better like this or like this there s been a raft of great feedback recently so i d just like to give shoutouts to u ainokalevala u scotsirishlassie and u kgaus27 for creating spaces to have excellent dialogue about poetry i felt a bit silly highlighting a specific comment from each of you when your output has just been enormous all of you are contributing a lot and don t think it s gone unnoticed u actualnameislana i think inspired by the hugbox went on a wild feedback binge a few days ago and i encourage everyone to read

you were a soft blur in everyday sight you left a sweet scent when you passed by me that masked your mysterious identity like a shadow impervious to light i only caught you with my fleeting eye your quaint stare fixed on the stars in the sky yet you were still a blur but you were quite the one person who fueled my delight x200b you were a sharp smudge in those works of art imperfect but perfection struck your heart i could see your passion in those fingers when they moved mere idleness broke apart i was moved by it and that was the start of why your blurred image that still lingers now jolted my impassioned hands to paint the picture of your smile that was still faint x200b you were a flash of lightning by the moon that i perhaps touched by its frantic tail and sent to your domain through a starry trail a dimension of shapeless lights that attune to the music released by your sweet voice like refreshing rain that calms the summer or spring s smooth winds singing me to slumber and dream in nights where my love could rejoice x200b you were a color within the dawn the morning sun resplendent in your glance awakening a sound that was long gone hope that chorus of god divinely done i could hear its phantom tunes within you dance i could see them scatter and cover the world the bright color of dawn ere me unfurled and you i could finally grasp perchance x200b but you were a twilight in paradise when sunset triumphs over the sunrise and the last color of the glorious morn quickly escapes and leaves the night forlorn a vestige of a masterpiece a ghost of a sentiment that filled me the most with much passion that i forgot the fear of knowing one day you will disappear x200b you are a shadow cast upon my road a darkness in my silent solitude when in lonely days i heave sorrow s load the bitter fate of life i understood the every detail of your happy face your loving ways i can never erase but the roads move always so i must too maybe i will forget all about you x200b https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments auek6r yell a haiku https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments auek6r yell a haiku x200b https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments auodau only fools fall in love https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments auodau only fools fall in love x200b

drunk on a monday i feel the sneer the inevitable curl of the lip and the staccato laugh that burns like the vodka in my sprite bottle exchanged glances rolled eyes and i laugh too but it pitches and rolls stumbles under the weight of heedless insincerity nbsp drunk on a monday and i can t be bothered to explain myself to the silence to the scratching of pencils on paper and the tapping of fingers on keys i harmonize my sips to the melody while a symphony of sympathy fills my ears nbsp drunk on a monday because tonight i need to call a tap out on this body and there s two ways out of here one looks like a bottle and forgetting the other is a razorblade and its kiss i ve tottered my way down both avenues before but i m getting tired of the scars nbsp drunk on a monday i lie in a bed next to my best friend and in the darkness i open my mouth pour out the secrets i can t stomach when i m sober nbsp but i m drunk and it s monday so he asks can we talk about this tomorrow and we both know he s asking for us to never talk about this again i swallow the truth and it turns my stomach worse than any liquor ever has i wish that a finger in my throat could expel it just as quickly 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8go8mi here she lies 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments 8gnzdg i dont want to forget you

today guilt rode at the center of my chest not a well constructed sphere of nothing no a moth eaten empty gash with edges that felt paper thin like they could collapse into a true hole in a moment in the time it takes to clench a jaw or scrape a knuckle along rough stone and it sucked in fat and ribs from all around to fill itself to stave off emptiness and it s the sucking that hurts that puts the pressure on your heart and lungs it s the vacuum that bites and pulls and guards growling at the core of you sometimes if you stare it squarely in the eye it will relax its jaws and let black sorrow seep out softly and it s a mark of how the guilt can twist that this will feel like flower s touch instead of fist 1 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments cw0cre demons ey84nar 2 https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments cw57n2 lying light ey8kgeg

and i can smile sometimes if i try really hard but it feels disingenuous so tell me what s the point of all this suffering when every day seems a little bit worse than the last one and you start wondering how many shitty days does it take how many shitty days turn into shitty weeks turn into shitty years that make up a shitty life that just doesn t seem worth living anymore and you want to ignore that omnipresent existential dread that always creeps up on you when you let your guard down and crawls into the back of your head through your ears and you fear that one day you ll find yourself emotionally and mentally dead but still living a philosophical zombie that can t see that this life has lost all meaning and value that you had once thought was intrinsic but now you re starting to think it isn t and you re starting to think all the lofty ideals you once clung to were all just fabrications of an overactive imagination and you want to lash out but you ve been self taught from childhood to keep your emotions to yourself so you just grit your teeth a little bit harder and clench your fists so tight that the nails break the skin https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments ae76u7 nothings https www reddit com r ocpoetry comments aee8e8 in its time
