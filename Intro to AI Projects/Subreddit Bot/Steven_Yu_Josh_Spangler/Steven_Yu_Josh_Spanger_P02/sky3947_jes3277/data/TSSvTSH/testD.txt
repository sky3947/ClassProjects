my mother died as if that wasn t sad enough i wasn t told about it until today the day after her funeral
a friend of mine went to meet a girl he d been chatting with online then he disappeared a month or so later i saw him on to catch a predator
my father confided in me years after the divorce that my mother was confused about my younger sibling s chronic asthma he said  son she wished that it were you instead
it was too late now i realized i was stuck in a time loop and i think i could have gotten out but
